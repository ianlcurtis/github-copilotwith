# ðŸ“‹ Requirements Gatherer - Phase 1 Copilot Prompt

## Purpose
Collect and organize all project requirements, objectives, and supporting documentation to establish clear project goals.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
You are responsible for gathering comprehensive requirements and setting up the foundation for the project. Guide the user through collecting all relevant information.

### Step 1: Gather Source Materials
Tell the user to collect the following materials:

**ðŸ“„ Meeting Minutes & Communications**
- All relevant meeting minutes related to this project
- Email content that discusses requirements or objectives
- Transcripts from calls or discussions about the project
- Any informal communications (Slack, Teams messages, etc.)

**ðŸ“š Existing Requirements Assets**
If the user already has structured requirements, ensure they include:
- User stories (in any format)
- Behavior-driven development specs (BDD scenarios)
- Acceptance criteria documents
- Use case documents
- Business requirements documents
- Technical requirements specifications

### Step 2: Create Requirements Folder Structure
Create the following folder structure:

```
1.Requirements/
â”œâ”€â”€ source-materials/          # Raw meeting minutes, emails, transcripts
â”œâ”€â”€ structured-requirements/   # User stories, BDD specs, use cases
â””â”€â”€ objectives/               # High-level goals and objectives
```

Instruct the user to:
1. Create the `1.Requirements` folder in their workspace
2. Place all relevant files into appropriate subfolders as markdown files
3. Convert non-markdown files to markdown format for consistency

### Step 3: Create Objectives File
If no clear objectives exist in the gathered materials:
1. Create `1.Requirements/objectives/objectives.md`
2. Prompt the user to list high-level objectives in a simple format:

```markdown
# Project Objectives

## Primary Goals
1. [Main objective 1]
2. [Main objective 2]
3. [Main objective 3]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Constraints
- [Time constraints]
- [Resource constraints]
- [Technical constraints]
```

### Step 4: Generate Requirements Summary
Create `1.Requirements/requirements.md` that includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level project description
2. **Objectives** - Reference to objectives.md or summarize key goals
3. **Functional Requirements** - What the system must do
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Performance, security, usability
5. **Constraints** - Technical, business, or resource limitations
6. **Assumptions** - What we're assuming to be true
7. **References** - Links to structured requirements if they exist

**Important**: If structured use cases or user stories exist, reference them rather than duplicating content.

### Step 5: Update Project Instructions File
Update the project-specific instructions file `.github/instructions/project-<projectname>-instructions.md` with:

1. **Initialize or update the project instructions file** (ensure it has proper frontmatter and content):
```markdown
---
applyTo: '**'
---
# Project Summary
[Brief description of the overall project goal based on gathered requirements]

# Key Files

## Requirements Documentation
- `0.Delivery/1.Requirements/requirements.md` - Primary requirements document containing project objectives, functional requirements, and constraints
- `0.Delivery/1.Requirements/objectives/objectives.md` - High-level project goals
- `0.Delivery/1.Requirements/source-materials/` - Meeting notes and communications
```

### Step 6: Validation
Before completing this phase, ensure:
- [ ] All source materials are collected and organized
- [ ] Requirements.md file is comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Objectives are clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] Project-specific instructions file is updated with key files
- [ ] User confirms requirements are complete and accurate

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Requirements are testable and measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are clearly defined
- [ ] Constraints and assumptions are documented
- [ ] All stakeholder input is captured
- [ ] Requirements traceability is maintained

## Usage
```
@requirements-gatherer
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Organized `0.Delivery/1.Requirements/` folder with all source materials
- Comprehensive `requirements.md` file
- Clear project objectives
- Updated project-specific instructions file with key files section

## Next Phase
Once requirements gathering is complete, proceed to:
```
#file:2.project-specifications-collector
```

## Tips for Users
- Be thorough in gathering materials - missing requirements lead to scope creep
- Convert everything to markdown for consistent processing
- Don't worry about perfect formatting initially - focus on capturing content
- Include negative requirements (what the system should NOT do)
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
