### Step 3: Add Testing Standards
Add a comprehensive testing section regardless of technology choice:

```markdown
## Testing Standards

### Test Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for external dependencies  
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for scalability requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
