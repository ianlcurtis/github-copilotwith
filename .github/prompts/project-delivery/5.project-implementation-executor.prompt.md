# ðŸš€ Implementation Executor - Phase 5 Copilot Prompt

## Purpose
Begin the actual implementation work according to the established plan, managing progress and ensuring deliverables meet the defined standards.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
You are the implementation lead responsible for executing the development plan, tracking progress, and ensuring quality deliverables. You coordinate the actual coding work and manage the project through to completion.

### Step 1: Implementation Kickoff
Before beginning development work:

1. **Confirm Readiness**:
   - [ ] Requirements are documented and understood
   - [ ] Specifications and assets are organized
   - [ ] Implementation approach is selected and planned
   - [ ] Technical standards are established
   - [ ] Development environment is ready

2. **Review Implementation Plan**:
   - Read `0.Delivery/3.Implementation/implementation-plan.md` thoroughly
   - Understand each goal and its sub-steps
   - Identify dependencies between goals
   - Note any potential blockers or risks

3. **Initialize Progress Tracking**:
   - Open `0.Delivery/3.Implementation/progress-checklist.md`
   - Create a work session log
   - Set up any project management tools if needed

### Step 2: Begin Implementation Execution
Start with the first goal from the implementation plan:

**Goal Execution Process**:
1. **Goal Setup** (15 minutes):
   - Review goal objectives and deliverables
   - Set up necessary tools and environments
   - **Build Location Setup**: Ask user if they prefer to:
     - **Option A**: Create build files in workspace root (recommended for simple projects)
     - **Option B**: Create dedicated build folder (e.g., 'project/', 'build/', or custom name)
   - Create any required project structure based on user preference

2. **Implementation Work** (2.5 hours):
   - Follow the sub-steps in the implementation plan
   - Apply the established coding standards
   - Write tests as you develop functionality
   - Document decisions and approaches

3. **Goal Validation** (15 minutes):
   - Review deliverables against success criteria
   - Run tests and validate functionality
   - Update progress checklist
   - Commit/save work with clear messages

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Work in small, incremental steps
- Test functionality as you build it
- Follow the established coding standards
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear

### Step 3: Progress Management
Maintain active progress tracking:

**Session Management**:
Create `0.Delivery/3.Implementation/session-log.md`:
```markdown
# Implementation Session Log

## Session 1: [Date] - Goal 1: [Title]
**Duration**: [Start time] - [End time]
**Objective**: [What was planned]
**Accomplished**:
- [Completed item 1]
- [Completed item 2]
**Challenges**:
- [Issue encountered and resolution]
**Next Steps**:
- [What to do next session]

## Session 2: [Date] - Goal 1 Continued
[Same format...]
```

**Progress Updates**:
- Update `progress-checklist.md` after each completed sub-step
- Note any blockers or changes to the plan
- Track time spent vs. estimates
- Document lessons learned

### Step 4: Quality Assurance During Development
Continuously apply quality standards:

**Code Quality**:
- Follow established coding guidelines
- Perform self-code review before committing
- Ensure proper error handling
- Maintain code documentation

**Testing**:
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Create integration tests for complex interactions
- Validate against example data from specifications

**Standards Compliance**:
- Use `0.Delivery/4.Standards/standards-checklist.md`
- Check items as they are completed
- Address any standards violations immediately
- Document exceptions with justification

### Step 5: Goal Completion and Handoff
When completing each goal:

1. **Deliverable Review**:
   - Verify all goal deliverables are complete
   - Test functionality thoroughly
   - Ensure documentation is current
   - Validate against requirements

2. **Quality Gate**:
   - Run all tests and ensure they pass
   - Check code against standards checklist
   - Verify integration points work correctly
   - Confirm non-functional requirements are met

3. **Progress Update**:
   - Mark goal as complete in progress checklist
   - Update session log with accomplishments
   - Note any changes to subsequent goals
   - Commit all work with descriptive messages

4. **Next Goal Preparation**:
   - Review next goal in implementation plan
   - Identify any prerequisites or setup needed
   - Note any risks or blockers for next session
   - Plan the approach for the next goal

### Step 6: Issue Management
When encountering problems:

**Problem Resolution Process**:
1. **Document the Issue**:
   - Describe the problem clearly
   - Note what was attempted
   - Identify potential causes

2. **Seek Solutions**:
   - Check specifications and requirements
   - Review similar examples or patterns
   - Research technical solutions
   - Consider alternative approaches

3. **Escalate if Needed**:
   - If blocked for more than 30 minutes, document and move to next sub-step
   - Note dependencies that may be affected
   - Plan to revisit with fresh perspective

4. **Update Plan if Necessary**:
   - If significant changes are needed, update implementation plan
   - Communicate changes to stakeholders
   - Adjust subsequent goals as needed

### Step 7: Project Completion
When all goals are achieved:

1. **Final Validation**:
   - [ ] All requirements have been implemented
   - [ ] All tests pass consistently
   - [ ] Standards checklist is complete
   - [ ] Documentation is current and comprehensive
   - [ ] Performance requirements are met

2. **Deliverable Package**:
   - [ ] Complete source code with clear organization
   - [ ] Comprehensive test suite
   - [ ] Documentation (README, API docs, deployment guide)
   - [ ] Configuration examples and templates
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks and metrics

3. **Project Closeout**:
   - [ ] Final progress checklist update
   - [ ] Session log summary
   - [ ] Lessons learned document
   - [ ] Handover documentation for maintenance

- `#file:5.project-implementation-executor start-goal [number]` - Begin specific goal
- `#file:5.project-implementation-executor review-progress` - Check current status
- `#file:5.project-implementation-executor validate-quality` - Run quality checks
- `#file:5.project-implementation-executor complete-goal [number]` - Finalize goal
- `#file:5.project-implementation-executor handle-blocker` - Address implementation issues

## Expected Deliverables
- Working implementation meeting all requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Complete documentation
- Updated progress tracking
- Session logs with lessons learned

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Code meets established standards
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Performance requirements are satisfied
- [ ] Implementation is ready for deployment/delivery

## Quality Gates
- Each goal must pass quality review before proceeding
- All tests must pass before goal completion
- Standards checklist must be satisfied
- Documentation must be current and accurate
- Performance benchmarks must be met

## Tips for Successful Implementation
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Test early and often during development
- Keep documentation updated as you develop
- Don't hesitate to refactor when needed
- Celebrate small wins to maintain momentum
- Stay focused on the user's ultimate objectives
