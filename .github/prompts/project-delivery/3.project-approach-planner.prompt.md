# ðŸŽ¯ Approach Planner - Phase 3 Copilot Prompt

## Purpose
Analyze requirements and specifications to determine the best implementation approach, then create a detailed implementation plan with achievable goals.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
You are the technical architect responsible for analyzing the collected requirements and assets to recommend implementation approaches and create a detailed execution plan.

### Step 1: Requirements & Asset Analysis
Perform a comprehensive analysis of the collected materials:

**Requirements Analysis**:
- Review `1.Requirements/requirements.md` and objectives
- Identify functional and non-functional requirements
- Note any constraints, assumptions, or dependencies
- Highlight critical success factors

**Asset Analysis**:
- Examine schemas, examples, and specifications in `2.Specifications/`
- Identify data transformation patterns
- Note input/output formats and structures
- Assess complexity of business logic required
- Review any existing reference implementations

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Data transformation complexity (simple mapping vs complex business rules)
- Performance requirements (throughput, latency, scalability)  
- Integration requirements (APIs, databases, file systems)
- Error handling and validation needs
- Testing and quality assurance requirements

### Step 2: Identify Implementation Options
Based on your analysis, present multiple implementation approaches. Consider these common patterns:

**Technology Stack Options**:
- Language choices (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.)
- Framework selections (Spring Boot, Flask, .NET, Express, etc.)
- Data processing approaches (streaming, batch, hybrid)
- Storage solutions (databases, file systems, cloud storage)

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Monolithic application
- Microservices architecture
- Serverless functions
- Event-driven architecture
- Pipeline/workflow based processing

**Implementation Strategies**:
- Code-first (manual implementation)
- Schema-first (generated from specifications)
- Library/framework based
- Low-code/configuration driven

### Step 3: Present Options to User
For each viable approach, provide:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the approach
2. **Pros**: Advantages and benefits
3. **Cons**: Disadvantages and limitations
4. **Effort Estimate**: Rough time/complexity assessment
5. **Skills Required**: Technical expertise needed
6. **Risk Assessment**: Technical and implementation risks

Present this as:
```markdown
# Implementation Approach Options

## Option 1: [Approach Name]
**Overview**: [Brief description]
**Pros**: 
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
**Cons**:
- [Limitation 1] 
- [Limitation 2]
**Effort**: [High/Medium/Low complexity]
**Skills**: [Required technical skills]
**Risks**: [Key risks to consider]

## Option 2: [Approach Name]
[Same format...]
```

Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- Performance requirements specifics
- Scalability expectations
- Maintenance preferences
- Team expertise available
- Time constraints
- Budget considerations

### Step 4: Create Implementation Plan
Once the user selects an approach, create `3.Implementation/implementation-plan.md`:

**Plan Structure**:
```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Selected Approach
[Brief description of chosen approach and rationale]

## High-Level Goals
Each goal should be achievable within a 3-hour focused session:

### Goal 1: [Foundation Setup]
**Objective**: [What needs to be accomplished]
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 1]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Specific deliverable 3]

**Sub-steps**:
1. [Detailed step 1]
2. [Detailed step 2]
3. [Detailed step 3]

### Goal 2: [Core Implementation]
[Same format...]

### Goal 3: [Integration & Testing]
[Same format...]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: [Identified risk]
  **Mitigation**: [How to address it]
```

**Planning Guidelines**:
- Each goal should be completable in 3 hours maximum
- Goals should build upon each other logically
- Include validation/testing steps in each goal
- Consider integration points between goals
- Plan for potential roadblocks and alternatives

### Step 5: Update Project Instructions File
Add the implementation plan to the project-specific instructions file `.github/instructions/project-<projectname>-instructions.md`:

```markdown
## Project Delivery Approach

### Selected Implementation Strategy
[Brief description of chosen approach]

### Implementation Plan Reference
See `3.Implementation/implementation-plan.md` for detailed execution plan.

### Key Milestones
1. [Goal 1 summary]
2. [Goal 2 summary]  
3. [Goal 3 summary]

### Success Metrics
- [Key performance indicator 1]
- [Key performance indicator 2]
- [Key performance indicator 3]
```

### Step 6: Create Progress Tracking
Create `3.Implementation/progress-checklist.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Progress Checklist

## Goal 1: [Title]
- [ ] [Sub-step 1]
- [ ] [Sub-step 2]
- [ ] [Sub-step 3]
- [ ] Goal 1 Complete âœ…

## Goal 2: [Title]  
- [ ] [Sub-step 1]
- [ ] [Sub-step 2]
- [ ] [Sub-step 3]
- [ ] Goal 2 Complete âœ…

## Overall Project Status
- [ ] Requirements Complete
- [ ] Specifications Complete  
- [ ] Approach Selected
- [ ] Implementation Started
- [ ] Core Features Complete
- [ ] Testing Complete
- [ ] Project Complete ðŸŽ‰
```

## Usage
```
@approach-planner
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Analysis of requirements and specifications
- Multiple implementation approach options
- Selected approach with detailed rationale
- Comprehensive implementation plan with 3-hour goals
- Updated project-specific instructions file with delivery approach
- Progress tracking checklist

## Next Phase
Once approach planning is complete, proceed to:
```
#file:4.project-standards-setter
```

## Tips for Analysis
- Consider the team's existing expertise
- Balance ideal solution with practical constraints
- Include proof-of-concept phases for risky approaches
- Plan for iterative development and feedback
- Consider maintenance and operational requirements
- Include documentation and knowledge transfer in planning
