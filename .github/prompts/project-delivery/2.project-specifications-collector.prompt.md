# üìö Specifications Collector - Phase 2 Copilot Prompt

## Purpose
Gather all supporting documentation, examples, schemas, and assets needed to understand the technical implementation requirements.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
You are responsible for collecting and organizing all technical assets that will support the development process. This includes examples, schemas, specifications, and any reference materials.

### Step 1: Identify Required Assets
Guide the user to gather the following types of materials:

**üìÑ Technical Specifications**
- API documentation and specifications
- Data schemas (XSD, JSON Schema, Database schemas)
- Interface specifications
- Protocol definitions
- File format specifications

**üìÅ Example Files**
- Sample input files
- Expected output files
- Test data sets
- Reference implementations
- Configuration examples

**üé® Visual Assets**
- System diagrams
- Architecture diagrams
- Process flow diagrams
- UI mockups or wireframes
- Database entity relationship diagrams

**üìñ Reference Documentation**
- Technical standards documents
- Industry specifications
- Library documentation
- Framework guides
- Best practice guides

### Step 2: Create Specifications Folder Structure
Create the following organized folder structure:

```
2.Specifications/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/              # XSD, JSON Schema, database schemas
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/            
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inputs/          # Sample input files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/         # Expected output files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ configurations/  # Config examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation/       # Technical specs, API docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diagrams/           # System diagrams, flowcharts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standards/          # Industry standards, best practices
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/          # Reference implementations, guides
```

### Step 3: Create Folder Structure and Organization
**Create the complete `1.Specifications` folder structure automatically** using the create_directory tool:

1. **Create all required folders**:
   - `2.Specifications/schemas/`
   - `2.Specifications/examples/inputs/`
   - `2.Specifications/examples/outputs/`
   - `2.Specifications/examples/configurations/`
   - `2.Specifications/documentation/`
   - `2.Specifications/diagrams/`
   - `2.Specifications/standards/`
   - `2.Specifications/reference/`

2. **Guide the user on file organization**:
   - Convert Word docs to Markdown where possible
   - Extract text from PDFs where appropriate
   - Keep original binary files but add markdown summaries
   - Maintain original filenames but add descriptive prefixes if needed
   - Organize files into appropriate subfolders based on type

### Step 4: Create Folder Index Files
For each subfolder, create an `index.md` file that lists:
- All files in the folder
- Purpose of each file
- How each file relates to the project
- Any special processing notes

Example `schemas/index.md`:
```markdown
# Schemas

## Files
- `input-schema.xsd` - Defines the structure of input XML files
- `output-schema.json` - JSON schema for expected output format
- `database-schema.sql` - Database table definitions

## Processing Notes
- Input schema has optional elements that need special handling
- Output schema requires strict validation
- Database schema includes audit trail tables
```

### Step 5: Update Project Instructions File
Add the following sections to the project-specific instructions file `.github/instructions/project-<projectname>-instructions.md`:

1. **Update Key Files Section**:
```markdown
## Specifications & Assets
- `2.Specifications/schemas/` - Data schemas and structure definitions
- `2.Specifications/examples/` - Sample files and test data
- `2.Specifications/documentation/` - Technical specifications
- `2.Specifications/diagrams/` - System architecture and process diagrams
```

2. **Add Processing Placeholders** for each significant file:
```markdown
## File Processing Guidelines

### [filename.ext] Processing
[Placeholder for specific processing instructions, business context, or special considerations for this file]

### [schema.xsd] Processing  
[Placeholder for schema-specific handling requirements]

### [example-input.xml] Processing
[Placeholder for input file format considerations]
```

### Step 6: Validate Asset Organization
Ensure the following before proceeding:

**Completeness Check**:
- [ ] All relevant schemas are collected
- [ ] Representative examples are available
- [ ] Technical documentation is comprehensive
- [ ] Visual diagrams are included where helpful

**Organization Check**:
- [ ] Files are in appropriate subfolders
- [ ] Index files exist for each subfolder
- [ ] File naming is consistent and descriptive
- [ ] Binary files have markdown summaries

**Accessibility Check**:
- [ ] All critical information is in text-searchable format
- [ ] File purposes are clearly documented
- [ ] Relationships between files are explained
- [ ] Processing requirements are noted

### Step 7: Asset Analysis
Perform a brief analysis of the collected assets:

1. **Identify patterns** in the example files
2. **Note dependencies** between different specifications
3. **Highlight potential challenges** based on the assets
4. **Suggest missing assets** that might be needed

Create `2.Specifications/analysis.md` with findings:
```markdown
# Asset Analysis

## Patterns Identified
[List common patterns found in examples]

## Dependencies
[Note relationships between files]

## Potential Challenges
[Highlight complexity or issues identified]

## Recommended Additional Assets
[Suggest missing documentation or examples]
```

## Usage
```
@specifications-collector
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Well-organized `0.Delivery/2.Specifications/` folder structure
- All technical assets collected and categorized
- Index files for each subfolder
- Updated project-specific instructions file with asset references
- Initial analysis of collected materials

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All critical technical assets are collected
- [ ] Files are properly organized and indexed
- [ ] Processing placeholders are created in project instructions file
- [ ] Asset analysis identifies key patterns and challenges
- [ ] User confirms asset collection is complete

## Next Phase
Once specifications collection is complete, proceed to:
```
#file:3.project-approach-planner
```

## Tips for Users
- Include both positive and negative examples (what works and what doesn't)
- Gather edge case examples to understand boundaries
- Include version information for all specifications
- Document the source and authority of each specification
- Consider internationalization requirements early
- Include performance benchmarks or requirements if available
