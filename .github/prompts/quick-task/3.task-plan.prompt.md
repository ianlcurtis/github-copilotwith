# üìã Quick Plan Creator - Phase 3

## Purpose
Break the selected approach into 3-7 concrete, actionable steps with clear deliverables.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
Transform the selected approach into a specific, executable plan.

### Step 1: Review Context
Read:
- `0.Delivery/[task-name]/objective.md` - Success criteria
- `0.Delivery/[task-name]/approach-options.md` - Selected approach

### Step 2: Break Down into Steps
Create 3-7 steps that are:
- **Specific**: Clear what to do
- **Testable**: Can verify completion
- **Ordered**: Logical sequence
- **Sized**: Each step 30min-2hrs max

**Good step example**:
"Update authentication middleware to use async/await pattern, test with existing auth tests"

**Poor step example**:
"Fix authentication" (too vague)

### Step 3: Identify Dependencies
For each step note:
- Files to read/understand
- Files to modify
- External dependencies (packages, APIs)
- Tests to run/update

### Step 4: Create Plan Document
Create `0.Delivery/[task-name]/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Execution Plan: [Task Name]

## Overview
**Approach**: [Selected approach name]
**Estimated Total Time**: [X hours]
**Risk Assessment**: [Low/Medium/High]

## Pre-Execution Checklist
- [ ] All required files identified and accessible
- [ ] Development environment ready
- [ ] Tests can be run
- [ ] Backup/branch created if needed

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: [Action-oriented title] ‚è≥
**Objective**: [What this achieves]
**Actions**:
- [ ] [Specific action 1]

## Rollback Plan
If things go wrong:
1. [Rollback step 1]
2. [Rollback step 2]

## Final Validation
Before marking complete:
- [ ] All steps executed
- [ ] All success criteria met (from objective.md)
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] No regressions introduced
```

### Step 5: Create Progress Tracker
Create `0.Delivery/[task-name]/progress.md`:

```markdown
# Progress Tracker

## Current Status
**Started**: [Date/Time]
**Current Step**: Step 1
**Overall Progress**: 0% (0/[N] steps complete)

## Step Log

### Step 1: [Title] - ‚è≥ Not Started
**Status**: Not Started
**Started**: --
**Completed**: --
**Notes**: --

## Time Log
| Step | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1    | [X]h      | --     | --    |
| 2    | [X]h      | --     | --    |

## Summary
[Will be filled at completion]
```

### Step 6: Review with User
Present the plan:
- Explain the step sequence
- Highlight any risks or assumptions
- Confirm the approach makes sense
- Ask if any steps need clarification

### Validation
Before proceeding:
- [ ] Plan has 3-7 actionable steps
- [ ] Each step has clear deliverables
- [ ] Files to modify are identified
- [ ] Validation criteria defined
- [ ] User understands and approves plan

### Completion
Inform the user:
"Plan created. Ready to begin execution."

Then call: `#file:4.task-execute`
