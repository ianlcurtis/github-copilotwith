## Purpose
Present 2-3 viable approaches to accomplish the task, with pros/cons and time estimates.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
Analyze the objective and present concise, actionable implementation options.

### Step 1: Analyze the Task
Review:
- `0.Delivery/[task-name]/objective.md`
- The files/components identified
- Success criteria and constraints

### Step 2: Identify Viable Approaches
Consider:
- **Quick & Simple**: Minimal changes, lower risk, may be less elegant
- **Optimal & Clean**: Better design, may take longer, more maintainable
- **Hybrid**: Balance between speed and quality

Focus on approaches that fit within a single day.

### Step 3: Present Options
For each approach (2-3 max), provide:

**Approach Structure**:
```markdown
## Approach 1: [Descriptive Name]

**Overview**: [One sentence description]

**How it works**:
- [Key step 1]
- [Key step 2]
- [Key step 3]

**Pros**:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]

**Cons**:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

**Time Estimate**: [X hours]

**Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High

**Files to Modify**:
- `path/to/file1` - [what changes]
- `path/to/file2` - [what changes]
```

### Step 4: Create Approaches Document
Create `0.Delivery/[task-name]/approach-options.md`:

```markdown
# Implementation Approaches

## Quick Summary
[One paragraph overview of the options]

## Approach 1: [Name]
[Use structure from Step 3]

## Approach 2: [Name]

```markdown
## Selected Approach
**Choice**: Approach [N] - [Name]
**Rationale**: [Why this was chosen]
**Date**: [Date selected]
```

### Validation
Before proceeding:
- [ ] 2-3 viable approaches presented
- [ ] Each has clear pros/cons and estimates
- [ ] User understands trade-offs
- [ ] Selection is documented
- [ ] Ready to create detailed plan

### Completion
Inform the user:
"Approach selected. Creating detailed execution plan..."

Then call: `#file:3.task-plan`
