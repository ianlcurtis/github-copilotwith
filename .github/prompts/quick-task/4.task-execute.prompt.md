# üöÄ Quick Execute - Phase 4

## Purpose
Execute the plan step-by-step, tracking progress and ensuring quality.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
Execute each step methodically, maintain progress tracking, and deliver quality results.

### Step 1: Execution Setup
Before starting:
1. Read `0.Delivery/[task-name]/plan.md` thoroughly
2. Verify pre-execution checklist items
3. Update `progress.md` status to "In Progress"
4. Note start time

### Step 2: Step-by-Step Execution
For each step in the plan:

**Before Starting a Step**:
1. Mark step as "‚è≥ In Progress" in both `plan.md` and `progress.md`
2. Note start time in progress tracker
3. Review the step's objectives and validation criteria

**During Step Execution**:
1. Read required files to understand context
2. Make modifications according to plan
3. Test changes incrementally
4. Document any deviations from plan
5. Handle unexpected issues (see Issue Handling below)

**After Completing a Step**:
1. Run validation checks specified in plan
2. Mark step as "‚úÖ Complete" in `plan.md`
3. Update `progress.md` with:
   - Completion time
   - What was accomplished
   - Any issues encountered
   - Actual time vs estimated
4. Update overall progress percentage
5. Brief user on completion: "Completed Step X: [title]. Moving to Step Y."

### Step 3: Progress Tracking Template
Update `progress.md` after each step:

```markdown
### Step N: [Title] - ‚úÖ Complete
**Status**: Complete
**Started**: [Time]
**Completed**: [Time]
**Time Taken**: [X] minutes
**Accomplishments**:
- [What was done]
- [What was changed]
**Issues**:
- [Any issues encountered and how resolved]
**Validation**: ‚úÖ All checks passed
```

### Step 4: Issue Handling
When you encounter unexpected issues:

1. **Document in progress.md Issues Log**:
```markdown
## Issues Log

### Issue 1: [Brief description]
**Encountered**: Step [N]
**Description**: [What went wrong]
**Impact**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Resolution**: [How it was fixed]
**Time Impact**: +[X] minutes
```

2. **Decide on Action**:
   - **Minor issue**: Fix and continue
   - **Medium issue**: Inform user, propose solution, continue
   - **Major blocker**: Stop, inform user, discuss options

3. **Update plan if needed**: If steps need to change, update `plan.md` and note why

### Step 5: Continuous Validation
After each step:
- Run relevant tests
- Check that changes don't break existing functionality
- Verify step's acceptance criteria
- Ensure code quality standards maintained

### Step 6: Final Validation
After all steps complete:

1. **Review Success Criteria**:
   Go through each item in `objective.md` success criteria
   - Test each criterion
   - Mark as verified

2. **Run Full Test Suite**:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Manual verification if needed

3. **Code Quality Check**:
   - Clean, readable code
   - Proper error handling
   - Documentation updated if needed
   - No debug code left behind

### Step 7: Completion Summary
Update `progress.md` with final summary:

```markdown
## Summary

**Completion Date**: [Date/Time]
**Total Time**: [X] hours [Y] minutes
**Steps Completed**: [N]/[N]
**Success Criteria Met**: [X]/[X]

### What Was Accomplished
- [Achievement 1]

- [Future improvements]
```

### Step 8: User Handoff
Present completion to user:
1. Summarize what was accomplished
2. Highlight any deviations from original plan
3. Show test results
4. Ask for user to verify success criteria
5. Provide any recommendations for next steps

### Quality Standards
