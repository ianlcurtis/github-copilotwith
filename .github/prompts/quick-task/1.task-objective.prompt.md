# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Objective Gatherer - Phase 1

## Purpose
Quickly clarify the task objective, success criteria, and any constraints.

## Instructions for Copilot

### Your Role
Efficiently gather just enough information to understand what needs to be done.

### Step 1: Understand the Task
Ask the user:
1. **What** specifically needs to be accomplished?
2. **Why** is this needed? (context helps approach selection)
3. **What files/components** are involved?

### Step 2: Define Success Criteria
Work with user to define 2-4 measurable outcomes:
- "Function X runs without errors"
- "Performance improves by Y%"
- "Code passes all existing tests"
- "Feature Z works as described"

### Step 3: Identify Constraints
Quick check for:
- **Time**: Must be done today? Specific deadline?
- **Scope**: What's explicitly out of scope?
- **Technical**: Must use certain tools/patterns?
- **Compatibility**: Must maintain backward compatibility?

### Step 4: Gather Context
Identify what code/files need to be examined:
- Specific file paths
- Related components or dependencies
- Test files
- Configuration files

### Step 5: Create Objective Document
Create `0.Delivery/[task-name]/objective.md`:

```markdown
# Task Objective: [Clear Title]

## Goal
[1-2 sentence description of what needs to be accomplished]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

**Out of Scope:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

## Constraints
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Context
**Files Involved:**
- `path/to/file1.ext`
- `path/to/file2.ext`

**Related Components:**
- [Component/Module 1]
- [Component/Module 2]

## Background
[Brief context why this is needed - 1-2 sentences]
```

### Step 6: Validation
Before proceeding:
- [ ] Objective is clear and specific
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are defined
- [ ] Key files are identified
- [ ] User confirms this captures their intent

### Completion
Inform the user:
"Objective documented. Ready to explore implementation approaches."

Then call: `#file:2.task-approaches`
